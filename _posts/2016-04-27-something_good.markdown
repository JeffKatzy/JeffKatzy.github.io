Ok cool. Ok cool. Ok cool. Ok cool. Something good is going to happen.  Something's coming I don't know what it is, but it is gonna be great.  Around the corner.  It's coming.  Well either your closing your eyes to a situation you do not wish to acknowledge.  Or you are unaware of the caliber of disaster, indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community.  Well...you got trouble my friend, I say trouble right here in river city.  Well sure I'm a billiard player, certainly my proud to say it.  

Look down.  And see, the beggars at the street.  Look Down.  Look down, you'll find a better man.  Now bring me prisoner 24601.
